                  Low Carbon Trade is a platform that will offer a spot market
                  for the voluntary carbon offset market . Our mission is to
                  provide a blockchain based ecosystem that connects buyers and
                  sellers of carbon offsets within this new exploding market
                  that is forecasted to grow in volume by 50 times by 2030.

                <p>
                  The voluntary carbon offset market is an increasingly

                  projects. By investing in carbon offsets, investors can
                  support projects that capture Co2 from the atmosphere while
                  also earning a financial return.
